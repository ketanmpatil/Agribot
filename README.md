            <p>This project works on concepts of control systems, path planning, image processinf and algorithm development.</p>
            <p>Tools such as the Robot Operating System, robotics simulator Gazebo, the Python programming language and many of its libraries are used.</p>
            <p>The competition consists of series of tasks, the final problem statement for the drone is to deliver various packages to their destinations, optimizing for time and quantity.</p>
