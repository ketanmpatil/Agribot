        <h1>Agribot</h1>
        <p>This project works on concepts of control systems, path planning, image processinf and algorithm development.
        </p>
        <p>Tools such as the Robot Operating System, robotics simulator Gazebo, the Python programming language and many
            of its libraries are used.</p>
        <p>The competition consists of series of tasks, the final problem statement for the drone is to deliver various
            packages to their destinations, optimizing for time and quantity.</p>

        <h1>TASK 1_3</h1>
        <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
        <p>The objective of this task is to move the agribot around the greenhouse such that the bot must pass either
            side of the trough atleast once.</p>

        <h1>TASK 2</h1>
        <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
        <p>The objective of this task is to manipulate the robotic arm to pluck the tomato from greenplant and drop it
            into Agribot's basket.</p>

        <h1>TASK 3_1</h1>
        <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
        <p>The objective of this task is to setup a perception pipeline so as to detect all the ripe tomato around the
            greenhouse as the robot traverses through the trough.</p>

        <h1>TASK 3_2</h1>
        <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
        <p>The objective of this task is to manipulate the robotic arm to pluck ripe tomatoes among all the tomatoes
            using the perception pipeline.</p>

        <h1>TASK 4</h1>
        <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
        <p>This is the stage where all the pieces come together. The objective was to create a algorithm to implement
            the problem statement, The bot must travel each trough in the greenhouse and search for red tomatoes. Once
            detected, the bot must pluck the red tomato and drop it into the basket and move to the next trough. After
            succesfully traversing all the trough, the bot must come back to start position in most efficient way.</p>
